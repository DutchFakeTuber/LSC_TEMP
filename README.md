## About
The LS Charge project is focussing on implementing EV-Chargers into light poles.
ELEQ does not have sufficient data to say with certainty that the power flowing through the light poles will influence the internal temperature of the light pole.

The LSC_TEMP project will tackle this by monitoring the internal temperature of the light pole using ESP32s.
These microcontrollers report back to the Raspberry Pi via the MQTT protocol.
All data can be read out via the LSC_TEMP website that is hosted on the Raspberry Pi.

## Used Components

## Setup Guide
This setup guide will explain the setup procedure of the ESP32 microcontrollers and the Raspberry Pi.
### Preparation
Make sure you have the following points done:

- Installed [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or newer.
- Have access to a Command Line Interface.
    - An IDE (like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) is preferable but [CMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmd.exe) can also be used.
- Cloned the [Github library](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.5/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) to the PC.
### ESP32
Before you start with the setup, make sure you have all the components mentioned in [Components ESP32](#components-esp32).
#### Flashing and Setup
The ESP32 can be flashed and set up with the `install.bat` tool. This script is specifically written to automate the flashing and setup process.

Before the files can be uploaded to the ESP32, make sure that the WLAN configuration settings are filled in. This is done by editing the [settings.py](/ESP32/wireless/settings.py) file:

``` Python
SSID: str = ''  # <- ADD SSID OF THE DESIRED NETWORK HERE
PASSWORD: str = ''  # <- PASSWORD OF THE DESIRED NETWORK

# NOTE: The SSID and PASSWORD need to be in parenthesis.
#       If there is a parenthesis in the PASSWORD,
#       please escape it by adding a '\' in front of the parenthesis.

# Check if the variables are empty
if (SSID, PASSWORD) == ('', ''):
    raise ValueError(
        "The SSID and PASSWORD for the WiFi-connectors are empty.\n\
        Please check the settings.py file in ESP32/wireless/"
    )
```

Save the changes you just made to the file.
Next, plug in the ESP32 and find the corresponding COM-port.
You can find it at: `Device Manager` -> `Ports (COM & LPT)`

When the COM-port is found, enter the following line in your preferred CLI:
``` Shell
.\install --port COMx --flash --setup
```
_Make sure that you are in the same directory as the `install.bat` file. You can make sure by copying the full directory path and enter it in the cli. Command: `cd 'full directory path'`._

The script should execute all necessary steps.

_The script uses the Python packages [adafruit-ampy](https://pypi.org/project/adafruit-ampy/) and [esptool](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esptool/en/latest/esp32/). Click on the links to see more information about the packages._
